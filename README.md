# ToDoGenerator

This is a simple "to-do" list application using vanilla JavaScript, HMTL, and CSS. This is intended to be a sandbox of sorts for me to develop new skills within these languages and practice or refine skills I already have. As the app develops, I will post new gifs of the app's functionality to track the progress.

## Things I Would Like to Add

- Animations
- Filtering
- Icons
- Drag and drop to reorder tasks

## Iteration 1

### Current Features

- Add to dos to a list
- Store to dos in local storage
- Mark to dos as complete
- Send to dos to trash (delete)
- Remove to dos from local storage when "Trash" is clicked
